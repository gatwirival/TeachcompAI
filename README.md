## Adding FAQ and Quiz Features

### Adding FAQ Section

The FAQ section provides answers to common questions about the app. Here‚Äôs how it was added:

1. **FAQ Expander**: Used `st.expander` to create expandable sections for each FAQ.

    ```python
    st.markdown("### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)")
    faq_expander = st.expander("How does this app work?")
    faq_expander.write("""
    This app uses the Google Gemini API to generate tutorials and guides for various computer skills. You provide the skill and your proficiency level, and the app generates content tailored to your needs.
    """)

    faq_expander = st.expander("Is the content generated always accurate?")
    faq_expander.write("""
    The content generated by the Google Gemini API is based on the information provided and is not guaranteed to be accurate or comprehensive. It should be used as a supplement to other learning resources.
    """)

    faq_expander = st.expander("How can I get a Google Gemini API key?")
    faq_expander.write("""
    You can get a Google Gemini API key by signing up on the [Google Gemini Makersuite website](https://makersuite.google.com/app/home).
    """)
    ```

### Adding Quiz Feature

The quiz feature allows users to generate quizzes on specific topics. Here‚Äôs how it was added:

1. **Quiz Generation Function**: Created a function `generate_quiz` to generate quizzes using Google Gemini.

    ```python
    def generate_quiz(topic):
        prompt = f"Generate a quiz on {topic} with 5 multiple-choice questions."
        config = {
            "temperature": 0.8,
            "max_output_tokens": 1024,
        }
        model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro", generation_config=config)
        with st.spinner("Generating your quiz using Gemini..."):
            response = model.generate_content(prompt)
            if response:
                st.write("### Your quiz:")
                st.write(response.text)
    ```

2. **Quizzes Page**: Added a new page for quizzes in the Streamlit app with an input field for the quiz topic and a button to generate the quiz.

    ```python
    elif page == "Quizzes":
        st.title("üìù Computer Skills Quizzes")
        st.caption("üéØ Test your knowledge with quizzes generated by Google Gemini")

        quiz_topic = st.text_input("Enter the topic for the quiz (e.g., Excel basics, safe browsing):", key="quiz_topic", value="Excel basics")

        if st.button("Generate Quiz", key="generate_quiz"):
            generate_quiz(quiz_topic)
    ```
